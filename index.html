                <h2>How I fell in love with you</h2>
                <p>I met you in August last year, and I still remember how naturally you entered my life.<br>
                There was no big moment where I told myself this is it.<br>
                It was quieter than that — more honest.</p>
                <p>I started looking forward to your messages.<br>
                I started feeling lighter after talking to you.<br>
                I started noticing that even on difficult days, you were the one I wanted to tell everything to.</p>
                <p>I fell in love with you in the smallest ways — in conversations that lasted longer than planned, in the comfort I felt just being myself around you, in the way you made distance feel less heavy.<br>
                Loving you didn’t feel scary. It felt familiar, like something my heart already knew.</p>
                <p>Even from far away, you became close to me.<br>
                And somewhere between those moments, without rushing or forcing anything, I fell for you — completely and sincerely.</p>

                <h2>Why you mean so much to me</h2>
                <p>You mean everything to me because you are my safe place, even from miles away.<br>
                In a world that constantly asks for strength, explanations, and perfection, you let me just be.</p>
                <p>You listen when I talk — not just to hear words, but to understand what I’m feeling underneath them.<br>
                You stay when I’m quiet, when I overthink, when I don’t know how to explain myself properly.<br>
                You never make me feel like I’m too much.</p>
                <p>Long distance isn’t easy, but with you, it feels worth it.<br>
                Because you show up in the ways that matter — with patience, reassurance, and care.<br>
                You remind me that love doesn’t need physical closeness to be real.</p>
                <p>You are the person I trust with my thoughts, my fears, my softness.<br>
                And that’s why you don’t just mean something to me — you mean everything.</p>

                <h2>Why you are such a wonderful person</h2>
                <p>You are a wonderful person because your love is genuine.<br>
                You don’t love loudly to impress — you love quietly, deeply, and sincerely.</p>
                <p>You try.<br>
                You care.<br>
                You put effort into understanding me, even when it’s not easy.<br>
                You choose kindness, even when the world doesn’t always return it.</p>
                <p>Being with you has taught me that love can be calm, steady, and safe.<br>
                That it can feel like reassurance instead of anxiety.<br>
                That it can feel like home, even across distance.</p>
                <p>I admire who you are — your heart, your intentions, the way you make people feel valued.<br>
                And I feel incredibly lucky that I get to be loved by someone like you.</p>
                <p>I don’t just love you for what you do for me.<br>
                I love you for who you are.<br>
                And I’m grateful for you — today, tomorrow, and every day in between.</p>
